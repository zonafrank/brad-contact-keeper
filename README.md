Contact Keeper app in the React back to front udemy course by Brad Traversy

After cloning the repo please run the following scripts:

1. npm run install
2. npm run clientInstall
3. npm run dev

This will start both the react.js client application and also start the server in development mode using nodemon.

To ensure that the build directory of the client app is present when running in production mode, please run the script:

1. npm run full-deploy

This will build the react app, and commit changes and push to the desired main git branch.
